                        Formula One (also known as Formula 1 or F1) is the highest class of international single-seater auto racing sanctioned by the Fédération 
                        Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and owned by the Formula One Group. The World Drivers' Championship, which became the FIA Formula One 
                        World Championship in 1981, has been one of the premier forms of racing around the world since its inaugural season in 1950. The word "formula" 
                        in the name refers to the set of rules to which all participants' cars must conform. A Formula One season consists of a series of races, 
                        known as Grands Prix (French for ''grand prizes' or 'great prizes''), which take place worldwide on purpose-built circuits and on public roads.
                        The results of each race are evaluated using a points system to determine two annual World Championships: one for drivers, the other for constructors.

                        Formula One cars are the fastest regulated road-course racing cars in the world, owing to very high cornering speeds achieved through the generation 
                        of large amounts of aerodynamic downforce. The cars underwent major changes in 2017, allowing wider front and rear wings, and wider tyres, 
                        resulting in peak cornering forces near 6.5 lateral g and top speeds of up to approximately 370 km/h (230 mph). As of 2019 the hybrid engines 
                        are limited in performance to a maximum of 15,000 rpm, the cars are very dependent on electronics and aerodynamics, suspension and tyres. Traction 
                        control and other driving aids have been banned since 2008.
