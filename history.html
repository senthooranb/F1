                            The Formula One series originated with the European Championship of Grand Prix motor racing (q.v. for pre-1947 history) of 
                            the 1920s and 1930s. Formula One was a new formula (new set of regulations) agreed upon after World War II during 1946, with 
                            the first non-championship races being held that year. The first Formula 1 race was the Turin Grand Prix. A number of Grand 
                            Prix racing organisations had laid out rules for a world championship before the war, but due to the suspension of racing 
                            during the conflict, the World Drivers' Championship was not formalised until 1947. The first world championship race was 
                            held at Silverstone, United Kingdom in 1950.<br>
                            The first World Championship for Drivers was won by Italian Giuseppe Farina in his Alfa Romeo in 1950, narrowly defeating 
                            his Argentine teammate Juan Manuel Fangio. <br>
                            This period featured teams managed by road car manufacturers Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz, and Maserati; all of whom had 
                            competed before the war. The first seasons were run using pre-war cars like Alfa's 158. They were front-engined, with narrow 
                            tyres and 1.5-litre supercharged or 4.5-litre naturally aspirated engines. <br>
                            When a new Formula One, for engines limited to 2.5 litres, was reinstated to the world championship for 1954, Mercedes-Benz 
                            introduced the advanced W196, which featured innovations such as desmodromic valves and fuel injection as well as enclosed 
                            streamlined bodywork. Mercedes drivers won the championship for two years, before the team withdrew from all motorsport in 
                            the wake of the 1955 Le Mans disaster.

                        An era of British dominance was ushered in by Mike Hawthorn and Vanwall's championship wins in 1958, although Stirling Moss had been 
                        at the forefront of the sport without ever securing the world title. Between Hawthorn, Jim Clark, Jackie Stewart, John Surtees and 
                        Graham Hill, British drivers won nine Drivers' Championships and British teams won fourteen Constructors' Championship titles 
                        between 1958 and 1974. The iconic British Racing Green Lotus, with a revolutionary aluminium-sheet monocoque chassis instead of 
                        the traditional space-frame design, was the dominant car, and in 1968, the team broke new boundaries, when they were the first to  
                        carry advertising on their cars.[

                    <p class="col-md-8">
                            The first major technological development, Bugatti's re-introduction of mid-engined cars (following Ferdinand Porsche's pioneering 
                            Auto Unions of the 1930s), occurred with the Type 251, which was unsuccessful. Australian Jack Brabham, world champion during 1959, 
                            1960, and 1966, soon proved the mid-engined design's superiority. By 1961, all regular competitors had switched to mid-engined cars.
                            During 1962, Lotus introduced a car with an aluminium-sheet monocoque chassis instead of the traditional space-frame design. This 
                            proved to be the greatest technological breakthrough since the introduction of mid-engined cars. During 1968, Lotus painted an 
                            Imperial Tobacco livery on their cars, thus introducing sponsorship to the sport.Aerodynamic downforce slowly gained importance in 
                            car design with the appearance of aerofoils during the late 1960s. During the late 1970s, Lotus introduced ground-effect aerodynamics 
                            (previously used on Jim Hall's Chaparral 2J during 1970) that provided enormous downforce and greatly increased cornering speeds. So 
                            great were the aerodynamic forces pressing the cars to the track (up to five times the car's weight), extremely stiff springs were 
                            needed to maintain a constant ride height, leaving the suspension virtually solid, depending entirely on the tyres for any small amount 
                            of cushioning of the car and driver from irregularities of the road surface.
